- 👋 Hi, I’m @JMorganUSU
- 👀 I’m interested in electric power systems, electrification of vehicles and buildings, and energy economics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git, how to use OpenDSS code libraries, and how to measure grid impact of new loads and control strategies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fixing NREL/ditto to properly convert latest-version Cyme files to OpenDSS.
